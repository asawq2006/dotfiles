# i highly recommend you use zsh instead of bash.
# zsh is a super-set of bash, so you'll get all the things you're
# used to in bash, but with a cherry on top. zsh has great completion
# features for tab-completing just about everything.
#
# more about zsh: http://www.zsh.org/

# if you insist on running bash, or for some reason you can't run
# zsh, you can still use all my aliases and get a cool-looking
# prompt as consolation :)
